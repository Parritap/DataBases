/**
GROUá¹” BY : is used to get set SET (so no repetition is admited) of the elements specified. For example
Lets imagine we have a table of customers with a column "country". Lets say that 5 of them are from Mexico, so 
we have 5 records where customer is from Mexico.

Now, the next clause will list the name of countries in the table Customers 

SELECT  Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;

Here, Mexico will only appear once along with all the countries that appear in the table.
